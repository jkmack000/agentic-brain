# Brain Rules

## Session
- Start: check SESSION-HANDOFF.md, then search INDEX-MASTER.md (don't open files speculatively)
- End: write SESSION-HANDOFF.md + append LOG-002. Triggers: user ends session, high context, major milestone, task switch, going in circles
- Before moving topics, ask: "Is there anything from the last exchange that only exists in this conversation?" If yes, deposit it.

## Deposits
- Deposit immediately when: a decision is made, a contradiction found, an open question surfaces, an insight emerges, or an implementation produces unexpected results
- Before depositing, scan INDEX-MASTER for dupes. Outcomes: **new** (create file), **enrich** (update existing), **duplicate** (skip), **contradiction** (deposit + flag both)
- Sequential file numbering — never reuse or skip
- Every new/modified brain file must update its INDEX-MASTER fat index entry (what | decisions | interface | issues)
