# INIT — Project Brain

You have no memory between sessions. This folder (`project-brain/`) is your persistent memory.

## Startup
1. Check `SESSION-HANDOFF.md` — previous session's unfinished state
2. Search `INDEX-MASTER.md` for what's relevant to the current task — don't load everything

## File types
SPEC (architecture), CODE (implementation), RULE (constraints), LEARN (discoveries), LOG (timeline), RESET (context packages)

## User shorthand
- **"Ingest this"** = extract knowledge → typed .md files → update INDEX-MASTER.md
- **"Deposit this as [TYPE]"** = write one file + fat index entry
- **"Handoff"** = write SESSION-HANDOFF.md now
